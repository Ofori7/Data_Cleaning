# Data_Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing a dataset for meaningful analysis. The dataset Grain_Clean is a cleaned data of a dataset that contained information on land deals, including variables such as year, country, investor, sector, production type, status of the deal, and projected investment. However, the raw data presents several inconsistencies, including missing values, formatting errors, spelling variations, and outliers, which need to be addressed before analysis can be performed accurately.
